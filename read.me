Project Title: Analyzing Oscar Winning Movies
by Diva

Introduction
The aim of this project is to analyze previous Oscar-winning movies and determine what characteristics they share that contribute to their success. 
I will be using two datasets, "oscars" and "movies", to explore the data and identify trends.

Data
The "oscars" dataset contains information about the Academy Awards ceremony, including the year, category, and winner of each award. 
The "movies" dataset includes information about movies such as their title, release year, genre, and ratings.

Methodology
I will begin by cleaning and merging the datasets to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis. 
Then, I will perform exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and trends in the data. We will also use statistical methods to test hypotheses and determine if certain characteristics are more likely to be found in Oscar-winning movies.

Results
By the end of the project, I hope to have a better understanding of what makes a movie successful at the Oscars. I will provide a detailed analysis of my findings and recommendations for filmmakers who wish to increase their chances of winning an Oscar.

Conclusion
This project aims to provide insights into what qualities Oscar-winning movies tend to have, which can be useful for filmmakers who want to create award-winning films. Our analysis will be based on data from previous winners and will provide an evidence-based approach to understanding what makes a movie successful at the Oscars.
